# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview: 
Pewlett-Hackard requests analysis of employees eligible to retire.The analysis consists of determining the count of employees eligible to retire by position based on birth date and current position date. Analysis was conducted on employees that were hired during 1985 and whose birth dates fell between January 1, 1952-December 31, 1955. Company leadership considers launching a mentoring program and inviting new retirees to participate as mentors for current employees and new hires.  

## Results: 
Analysis results indicate that Pewlett-Hackard may experience a mass shift in employees due to more than 64,000 employees becoming eligible for retirement. With further analysis Pewlett-Hackard learned some key data points. 

	- 78.4% of potential retirees hold current titles of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff. 
	- 15% of potential retirees work in two departments: Sales and Development.
	- Employees with the title of Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer and 		  Manager will account for 21.6% of retirements.Employees with these current titles may 		  be prospects for promotion. 
	- Approximately 1550 staff with birth dates in 1965 were identified to participate in the      	  new mentoring program.

## Summary: 
Pewlett-Hackard has the potential to experience a mass retirement exodus, about 22% of their 300,000 overall employees.The company used the information collected to determine the need to prepare through succession planning by adding a mentoring program in which new retirees have the opportunity to mentor employees advancing in their careers.

Questions Pewlett-Hackard leadership may consider: 
	- Will all employees eligible to retire actually retire? What incentives might they offer to 	  Senior Engineers and Senior Staff to retain them while training successors? Is there a 	  potential cost saving with the mass exodus? Are salaries competive to the current market? 
 
		- Salary ranges 
			- Average salary = $52,970
			- Minimum salary = $40,000
			- Maximum salary = $129,492

	- In addition to adding a mentoring program should Pewlett-Hackard implement to ensure 	  	  sucession strategies are always considered? 

With retirement comes the opportunity for Pewlett-Hackard to reconsider their employee structure by department. Technology advancements may require of shift of department size due to added need in some departments comparative to others. While a high volume of retirements may prove unsettling initially this may be an opportunity for new business strategies to be launched.
